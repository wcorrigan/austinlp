This coming meetup we will write a program together. 
You will get more out of our meetup if you write the program described below for yourself before we get together. 
Don't worry if you can't quite get everything to work. If you do get everything to work, go for the extra credits. 
  
******Challenge ************** 
guess_my_number.py 
Create a game for a user to guess a number from 1 to 10 picked by the program. 
Start the game by printing "Hello, would you like to guess my number? y or n" 
(Hint: be sure to look at raw_input() ) 

If the user enters a yes, allow the user to input a guess. 
If the user answers no, exit. 
Print "What's my number?" 
Get a guess from the user. 
Compare the guess with the number picked by the program. 
If the guess is equal to the picked number, print  "You win. Would you like to play again?y or n" 
If the user inputs yes, pick a new number and start playing again. 
If no, exit 
  
If the guess does not equal the picked number, print "You lose." 
If the guess is greater than the number, print "My number is smaller." 
If the guess is smaller than the number, print "My number is larger." 
Print "Guess again? y or n" 
Continue guessing until the user guesses successfully or answers no. 
If the user guesses correctly, ask to play again. 
If the user inputs yes, start playing again. 
If no, exit. 

On exit print "Thanks for playing, let's play again sometime." 
Bonus points for 

computer attitude (You can spice up the dialog in your program, G rating please) 
for code that can be read without needing excessive comments 
for use of  conditional expressions where appropriate 
for clean logic without needless repetition 
for the fewest lines of code 

  
*********Extra Credit: ***************************** 
Pseudo-code is writing out in natural language what you plan to write in code. 
Write out a guess_your_number.py program in pseudo-code. 
guess_your_number.py should work similarly to guess_my_number.py. 
Instead of guessing a number the computer picks, write a program where you pick a number from 1 to 10 and the computer tries to guess what number you have picked. 
  
************Extra Extra Credit************** 
Turn your extra credit pseudo-code into a python program. 
Have fun,
