# Numbers

[Official Python Docs](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers)

Python handles math and numbers in a very logical manner and is similar to many other programming languages.

Addition is done with the + symbol.

	# Add 2 and 2
	>>>> 2+2
	4

Subtraction is done with the - symbol.

	# Subtract 2 from 4
	>>>> 4-2
	2

Multiplication is done with the * symbol.

	# Multiply 2 and 4
	>>>> 2*4
	8

Division is done with the / symbol. The difference between integers and floating point numbers is significant in python. Division of two integers returns the floor (it will round down to the nearest integer). Floating point is simple as well.

	# Divide 8 by 2
	>>>> 8/2
	4

	# Divide 8.0 by 3.2
	>>>> 8.0/3.2
	2.5

	# Divide 8 by 3
	>>>> 8/3
	2

The last example shows how python handles dividing two integers. Python returns the nearest integer rounded down. To get a more precise value convert to floating point.

	# Get a more precise version of 8/3
	>>>> 8.0/3
	2.6666666666666665

The modulus operator return the remainder of two numbers.

	# Get the remainder of 10/4
	>>>> 10%4
	2

Python is capable of handling very advanced mathematics. Documentation can be found in the [Python Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers) and more advanced math can be done with the [math module](http://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html).
